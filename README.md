Python for 3D Printing Book
===========================

Following along the examples from the book


### Study notes


**Migrating to SolidPython**

- From chapter 16 (Rotate extrude) of the book, I decided to pickup the
  SolidPython library to do the exercises.
- When translating the examples to SolidPython, I've realized an "oversight"
  of learning OpenScad through the book whilst using the author's own OpenScad
  translation library.
- The author's library provides a lot of shortcuts and conveniences which is
  great to get started but detracts you to "get" the process and design flow of
  OpenScad.
- SolidPython's approach follows closely the OpenScad thinking and provides
  little conveniences. This gave me a moment of disconnect.
- The first 4 steps of this [Instructible](https://www.instructables.com/OpenSCAD-The-Instructable/),
  set me in the right direction and I was able to convert the examples in the
  book so far.
- I plan to continue through the examples in the book and maybe get around
  finishing the Instructible as well.


**Other notes**

- I'm using the Kindle version of the book. and unfortunately the code samples
  are in image form so you'll really have to type stuff in yourself. I find
  that this may be a good thing for learning.
- One annoying thing is that the author will leave you to search the internet
  for the libraries he uses (both his custom translation lib and the the
  OpenScad libs). I was able to find these and am including them in this repo
  for reference. I wish he would've uploaded the libs on github or somewhere
  easily accessible like any decent tech author would do.
- The author have created a lot of convenience objects that builts on top
  of the basic OpenScad objects (i.e. triangle, regular_polygon, etc.). I've
  translated some of them to SolidPython.
