Python for 3D Printing Book
===========================

Following along the examples from the book


### Study notes


- From chapter 16 (Rotate extrude) of the book, I decided to pickup the
  SolidPython library to do the exercises.
- When translating the examples to SolidPython, I've realized an "oversight"
  of learning OpenScad through the book whilst using the author's own OpenScad
  translation library.
- The author's library provides a lot of shortcuts and conveniences which is
  great to get started but detracts you to "get" the process and design flow of
  OpenScad.
- SolidPython's approach follows closely the OpenScad thinking and provides
  little conveniences. This gave me a moment of disconnect.
- The first 4 steps of this [Instructible](https://www.instructables.com/OpenSCAD-The-Instructable/), set me in the right direction and I was able to convert
  the examples in the book so far.
- I plan to continue through the examples in the book and maybe get around
  finishing the Instructible as well.
